This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict stock prices. It consists of both classification and regression tasks, trained on the TATAGLOBAL dataset.
Data preprocessing is done with Pandas, and Matplotlib is used for visualization. Hyperparameters are optimized using grid search and cross-validation, ensuring robust model performance. 
The classification model achieved an accuracy of 84% and 86% after scaling, indicating reliable predictions for stock trends. The regression component, evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), provides valuable insights into price movements.
This project offers a comprehensive approach to stock price prediction with KNN.
