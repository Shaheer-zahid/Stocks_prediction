This project predicts stock prices using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It involves classification to predict stock trends and regression to forecast prices. The dataset is preprocessed with Pandas and visualized using Matplotlib. Hyperparameters are tuned through grid search, and cross-validation is employed to ensure model reliability. The project demonstrates classification accuracy of 84-86% and a detailed regression analysis with RMSE.
